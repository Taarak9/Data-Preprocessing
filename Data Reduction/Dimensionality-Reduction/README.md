# Dimensionality Reduction
* Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
    * Transforming the data to a new basis where the dimensions have low covariance and high variance
    * Let X be the original matrix consisting the data points as rows and let P be the matrix whose columns are linearly independent orthonormal vectors. hat{X} = XP is the matrix of transformed points.           
    * Applied to the Iris Dataset
* Reduct computation
